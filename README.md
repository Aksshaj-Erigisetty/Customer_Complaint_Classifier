# Customer Complaint Classifier  

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies **customer complaints** into multiple categories using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.  
Additionally, it performs **sentiment analysis** using TextBlob to detect whether complaints are written in a positive, negative, or neutral tone.  
Developed as part of an applied **Data Science & Machine Learning** portfolio.

## Project Overview  

Customer complaints contain valuable insights about service quality and recurring issues faced by users.  
This project leverages **machine learning and NLP** to automatically classify complaints and uncover overall customer sentiment.  

The primary goals of this project were to:  
- Build a text classification model that categorizes complaints by **product/service type**.  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** to understand the emotional tone of customer feedback.  
- Visualize complaint distribution and sentiment trends using **Matplotlib**.

## Workflow: CRISP-DM Framework  

1. **Business Understanding** – Identify how text analytics can improve customer service and complaint handling.  
2. **Data Understanding** – Explore patterns across 10+ complaint categories and thousands of textual narratives.  
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean text by removing punctuation, special characters, and converting to lowercase.  
4. **Modeling** – Apply **TF-IDF** to transform text into numeric features, and train a **Logistic Regression** classifier.  
5. **Evaluation** – Measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate performance.  
6. **Deployment** – Visualize key insights to assist organizations in understanding complaint trends.
